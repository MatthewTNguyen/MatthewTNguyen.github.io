      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        My mission is to build a successful and financially stable life while making the people around me proud through my actions and
        accomplishments. I strive to bring fun and positivity into the lives of others, live responsibly by caring for the environment, and
        continuously work on bettering myself by leaving behind unhelpful habits. I want to be known as someone who pursued success
        with integrity, joy, and responsibility.
